## Prediction of Non-acceptance of University Offer

Goal of this ML project is to predict applicants who do not accept after being offered a place to study at various partner universities at the undergraduate level.

This project *uses real organizational data* and thus some parts have been excluded, such as EDA, checking data values, etc. Results such as Confustion Matrix shows percentages instead.

## Results

Several models were tested and tuned. The best model was a Random Forest with the following metrics:
- AUC: 0.90
- Accuracy: 0.90
- Precision 0.86
- Recall: 0.75
