## Prediction of Non-acceptance of University Offer

Goal of this ML project is to predict applicants who do not accept after being offered a place to study at various partner universities at the undergraduate level.

This project uses real organizational data and thus all EDA parts have been removed. 
Results such as Confustion Matrix shows percentages instead.

## Results

Several models were tested and tuned. The best model was a Random Forest with the following metrics:
- AUC: 0.90
- Accuracy: 0.90
- Precision 0.86
- Recall: 0.75
